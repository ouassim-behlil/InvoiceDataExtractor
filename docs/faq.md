# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### Q: What types of invoices can be processed?
A: The system can process most standard invoice formats in JPG or PNG format. The invoices should be clear, well-lit, and contain standard invoice information like numbers, dates, amounts, and line items.

### Q: What is the recommended image resolution?
A: We recommend images with at least 300 DPI resolution. Higher resolution generally provides better results, but files should be optimized if they exceed 5MB.

### Q: How accurate is the extraction?
A: The accuracy depends on image quality and invoice format. With clear, well-formatted invoices, the accuracy is typically very high. All extracted data goes through rigorous validation to ensure consistency.

## Technical Questions

### Q: Why am I getting authentication errors?
A: Common reasons include:
- Invalid API key
- Expired API key
- Whitespace in the API key file
- Network connectivity issues

### Q: How can I process multiple invoices efficiently?
A: You can use batch processing with parallel execution:
```python
import concurrent.futures

def process_batch(invoice_files, max_workers=4):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        futures = {executor.submit(process_single_invoice, f): f for f in invoice_files}
        return {f: future.result() for future, f in futures.items()}
```

### Q: What should I do if validation fails?
A: Check the validation errors returned in the result:
1. Verify required fields are present
2. Check numeric fields contain valid numbers
3. Ensure calculations are correct
4. Validate date formats
5. Check for any business rule violations

## Error Handling

### Q: How do I handle network timeouts?
A: Implement retry logic:
```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
def process_with_retry(image_path):
    return processor.extract_json_from_image(image_path)
```

### Q: What if the extracted data is incomplete?
A: Check the following:
1. Image quality
2. Document orientation
3. Required fields visibility
4. OCR confidence scores
5. Validation error messages

## Performance

### Q: How can I optimize processing speed?
A: Several strategies:
1. Batch processing
2. Image optimization
3. Caching results
4. Parallel processing
5. Regular API key rotation

### Q: What's the recommended batch size?
A: For optimal performance:
- Standard processing: 10-20 invoices
- Parallel processing: 4-8 concurrent tasks
- Maximum batch size: 50 invoices

## Integration

### Q: Can I integrate this with other systems?
A: Yes, the system can be integrated with:
- ERP systems
- Accounting software
- Document management systems
- Custom workflows

### Q: How can I extend the validation rules?
A: You can add custom validation rules:
```python
def custom_validator(invoice_data):
    custom_errors = []
    # Add your custom validation logic
    return custom_errors

def validate_with_custom_rules(invoice_data):
    # Standard validation
    result = validate_invoice_data(invoice_data)
    
    # Add custom validation
    custom_errors = custom_validator(invoice_data)
    if custom_errors:
        result["errors"].extend(custom_errors)
        result["total_errors"] += len(custom_errors)
        result["is_valid"] = False
    
    return result
```

## Maintenance

### Q: How often should I update the system?
A: Regular maintenance includes:
- Weekly API key rotation
- Monthly performance review
- Regular dependency updates
- Periodic model updates

### Q: How can I monitor system performance?
A: Implement logging and monitoring:
```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

def monitor_processing(image_path):
    start_time = datetime.now()
    try:
        result = processor.extract_json_from_image(image_path)
        processing_time = datetime.now() - start_time
        logging.info(f"Processed {image_path} in {processing_time.total_seconds():.2f}s")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to process {image_path}: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

## Support

### Q: Where can I get help?
A: Support options include:
1. Documentation in the `docs` folder
2. GitHub issues
3. Community forums
4. Direct support channels

### Q: How do I report bugs?
A: When reporting issues:
1. Provide steps to reproduce
2. Include error messages
3. Share sample invoice (redacted)
4. Describe expected behavior
5. List environment details
